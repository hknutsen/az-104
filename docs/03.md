# Implement and manage storage in Azure

## Configure storage accounts

- Azure Storage
- Supports three categories of data:
  1. Structured data
  1. Unstructured data
  1. Virtual machine data
- Storage account
- Storage account tiers
  - Standard
    - Backed by hard disk drives (HDD)
    - Lowest cost per GB
    - Useful for bulk storage or infrequently accessed data
  - Premium
    - Solid state drives (SSD)
    - Lowest latency performance
    - Useful for frequently accessed data
  - Cannot convert tiers! (requires creating new storage account)
- Storage services
  - Blob storage
    - Blob containers
    - Unstructured data
    - Accessible over HTTP and HTTPS
    - Blob types:

      | Type | Usage |
      | --- | --- |
      | Block blobs | Most scenarios |
      | Append blobs | Scenarios where data is added to files over time |
      | Page blobs | Scenarios that require storing index-based and sparse data structures (operating systems, virtual machine data disk, databases etc.) |

    - Common use cases:
      - Storing documents, images, audio, video etc.
      - Backup and restore, disaster recovery, archiving etc.
  - File storage
    - Network file shares
    - Accessible over Server Message Block (SMB) and Network File System (NFS) protocols
      - SMB for standard and premium tiers, NFS for premium only
    - Common use cases:
      - Easy migration from on-prem to cloud for applications that rely of file shares
      - Share data, tools and configuration files between multiple virtual machines
      - Store diagnostic logs, metrics and crash dumps for later processing or analyzing
  - Queue storage
    - Message queues
    - Asynchronous processing (i.e. messages are queued then processed one at a time)
    - Common use cases:
      - Create backlog of work to process
  - Table storage
    - Non-relational structured data (aka. NoSQL data)
      ![Azure table storage](../img/azure-table-storage.png)
    - Common use cases:
      - Customer data
      - Product data
- Storage account types:

  | Type | Services | Usage |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Standard general-purpose v2 (GPv2) | Blob storage (including Data Lake storage), File storage, Queue storage, Table storage | Most scenarios |
  | Premium block blobs | Blob storage | Scenarios that require low latency performance |
  | Premium file shares | File storage | Scenarios that require both SMB and NFS file shares |
  | Premium page blobs | Blob storage (page blobs only) | Scenarios that require random read/write storage (operating systems, virtual machine data disks, databases etc.) |

- Replication
  - Locally redundant storage (LRS)
    - Three replicas within same data center in primary region
    - All replicas in separate fault and upgrade domains
    - Lowest cost
  - Zone redundant storage (ZRS)
    - Three replicas in separate data centers in primary region
  - Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
    - Replica in secondary region
    - LRS in both primary and secondary regions
    - Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
      - Read access to replica in secondary region
  - Geo-zone redundant storage (GZRS)
    - ZRS + GRS
    - Three replicas in separate data centers in primary region
    - Replica in secondary region
    - LRS in secondary region
    - Read-access geo-zone redundant storage (RA-GZRS)
      - Read access to replica in secondary region
- Default endpoints:

  | Service | Endpoint |
  | --- | --- |
  | Blob service | `<storage_account_name>.blob.core.windows.net` |
  | File service | `<storage_account_name>.file.core.windows.net` |
  | Queue service | `<storage_account_name>.queue.core.windows.net` |
  | Table service | `<storage_account_name>.table.core.windows.net` |

  > **Note**
  >
  > All Azure resources that are provided with an endpoint must have globally unique names.
  > This is to ensure that the endpoint is also globally unique.

- Custom domains
- Secure endpoints using firewall
- Automation
  - Azure CLI
  - Azure PowerShell
  - ARM / Bicep templates
  - SDKs (.NET, Python, Go, etc.)
