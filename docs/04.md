# Deploy and manage Azure compute resources

## Configure virtual machines

- Azure virtual machines (aka. VM)
- Basis of Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model
- A VM provides its own operating system (OS), storage and networking capabilities
- Why VMs instead of on-prem machines? A few select examples:
  - Easy setup/teardown of dev/test environments
  - Running VMs can be cheaper than on-prem machines
  - Avoid complexities of storage management
  - High performance computing
- Plan VMs:
  - Virtual network (vNet)
    - Provides private connection to other Azure services
    - Not easy to change later
    - By default: all outbound traffic allowed, inbound traffic allowed from within vNet
  - VM name
    - Windows: up to 15 characters
    - Linux: up to 64 characters
    - Not easy to change later
    - Choose a naming convention that is meaningful and consistent
      - Example naming convention: `vm<application><role><environment><location><instance>`
      - Example name: Consider a virtual machine (`vm`) for an application Foobar (`foo`) that will be used as a GitHub runner (`gh`) in the production (`prod`) environment. It will be located in North Europe (`ne`) and should support scaling to multiple instances (`01`): `vmfooghprodne01`.
  - Location
    - Performance / latency
    - Compliance
    - Legal requirements
    - Each region has different hardware available
    - Each region has different prices
  - VM size
    - CPU
    - Memory
    - Storage
    - Depends on expected workload
  - Azure Storage
    - Azure Managed Disks
      - Automatically creates and manages Storage account for you
      - You decide performance tier (standard HDD / premium SSD) and disk size
    - TODO: do you have to use Azure Managed Disks?
  - OS
    - Several versions of Windows
    - Several flavors + versions of Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
    - Azure Marketplace: install images that include both OS and software tools
  - Pricing
    - VMs have two separate costs: compute and storage
    - Compute
      - Priced on per-hour basis
      - Billed on per-minute basis
      - For example, if a VM runs for 55 minutes, it's billed for 55 minutes
      - Hourly price depends on VM size
      - Payment options:
        1. Consumption-based
            - Useful for short-term or unpredictable workfloads
            - Increase / decrease compute capacity on demand
            - Start and stop at any time
            - Unpredictable budget
        1. Reserved instances:
            - Advance purchase of VM for 1 or 3 years in specified region
            - Useful for constant workloads
            - Predictable budget
            - Up to 72% price savings
            - Can be returned for early termination fee
    - Storage
      - Same pricing as Azure Storage
- VM sizes (SKUs)

  | Classification | Description | Scenarios |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | General purpose | Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio | Development, testing... |
  | Compute optimized | High CPU-to-memory ratio | Processing services (e.g. web servers, network appliances, batch processors...)
  | Memory optimized | High memory-to-CPU ratio | Services that consume a lot of memory (database server, caches...) |
  | Storage optimized | Designed to have high disk throughput and I/O | Services where a lot of data go in/out (Big Data, SQL databases, data warehousing...) |
  | GPU | Designed for heavy graphics rendering and video editing | Model training, deep learning... |
  | High performance computes | Offers fastest and most powerful CPUs with optional high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA) | Workloads that require fast performance (high traffic networks) |

  - Resize whenever
- VM storage
  - All VMs have at least two disks:
    1. OS disk (`C:/` by default on Windows)
    1. Temporary disk (`D:/` by default on Windows)
        - Can be used by applications to store temporary data
        - Don't store critical data here!
  - Can also have one or more data disks (labeled with a letter you choose)
  - All disks are stored as virtual hard disks (VHDs) (stored as page blobs in Azure Blob Storage)
- Connect to VM
  - Secure Shell (SSH) protocol using terminal
    - Private-public key pair
    - User has private key
    - VM has public key
  - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) using Remote Desktop app (Windows only?)
  - Azure Bastion
    - Separate Azure service
    - No public IP needed
    - Created in virtual network
    - Provides secure SSH and RDP connection to all VMs in virtual network directly from Azure Portal
    - Requires appropriate RBAC permissions on Bastion resource
