# Deploy and manage Azure compute resources

## Configure virtual machines

- Azure virtual machines (aka. VM)
- Basis of Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model
- A VM provides its own operating system (OS), storage and networking capabilities
- Why VMs instead of on-prem machines? A few select examples:
  - Easy setup/teardown of dev/test environments
  - Running VMs can be cheaper than on-prem machines
  - Avoid complexities of storage management
  - High performance computing
- Plan VMs:
  - Virtual network (vNet)
    - Provides private connection to other Azure services
    - Not easy to change later
    - By default: all outbound traffic allowed, inbound traffic allowed from within vNet
  - VM name
    - Windows: up to 15 characters
    - Linux: up to 64 characters
    - Not easy to change later
    - Choose a naming convention that is meaningful and consistent
      - Example naming convention: `vm<application><role><environment><location><instance>`
      - Example name: Consider a virtual machine (`vm`) for an application Foobar (`foo`) that will be used as a GitHub runner (`gh`) in the production (`prod`) environment. It will be located in North Europe (`ne`) and should support scaling to multiple instances (`01`): `vmfooghprodne01`.
  - Location
    - Performance / latency
    - Compliance
    - Legal requirements
    - Each region has different hardware available
    - Each region has different prices
  - VM size
    - CPU
    - Memory
    - Storage
    - Depends on expected workload
  - Azure Storage
    - Azure Managed Disks
      - Automatically creates and manages Storage account for you
      - You decide performance tier (standard HDD / premium SSD) and disk size
    - Unmanaged disks
      - You are responsible for the Storage account
      - A single Storage account is capable of supporting around 40 standard disks
        - If you need more than that, you'll need to scale by creating more Storage accounts
        - Managed Disks would deal with the scaling for you
  - OS
    - Several versions of Windows
    - Several flavors + versions of Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
    - Azure Marketplace: install images that include both OS and software tools
  - Pricing
    - VMs have two separate costs: compute and storage
    - Compute
      - Priced on per-hour basis
      - Billed on per-minute basis
      - For example, if a VM runs for 55 minutes, it's billed for 55 minutes
      - Hourly price depends on VM size
      - Payment options:
        1. Consumption-based
            - Pay for what you use
            - Useful for short-term or unpredictable workfloads
            - Increase / decrease compute capacity on demand
            - Start and stop at any time
            - Unpredictable budget
        1. Reserved instances:
            - Advance purchase of VM for 1 or 3 years in specified region
            - Useful for constant workloads
            - Predictable budget
            - Up to 72% price savings
            - Can be returned for early termination fee
    - Storage
      - Same pricing as Azure Storage
- VM sizes (SKUs)

  | Classification | Description | Scenarios |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | General purpose | Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio | Development, testing... |

  | High performance computes | Offers fastest and most powerful CPUs with optional high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA) | Workloads that require fast performance (high traffic networks) |

  - Resize whenever
- VM storage
  - All VMs have at least two disks:
    1. OS disk (`C:/` by default on Windows)
    1. Temporary disk (`D:/` by default on Windows)
        - Can be used by applications to store temporary data
        - Don't store critical data here!
  - Can also have one or more data disks (labeled with a letter you choose)
  - All disks are stored as virtual hard disks (VHDs) (stored as page blobs in Azure Blob Storage)
- Connect to VM
  - Secure Shell (SSH) protocol using terminal
    - Private-public key pair
    - User has private key
    - VM has public key
    - Requires public IP
  - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) using Remote Desktop app
    - Requires public IP
    - Only available for Windows VMs
  - Azure Bastion
    - Separate Azure service
    - No public IP needed
    - Created in virtual network
    - Provides secure SSH and RDP connection to all VMs in virtual network directly from Azure Portal
    - Requires appropriate RBAC permissions on Bastion resource

## Configure virtual machine availability

- Availability
- What can affect availability?
  - Planned maintenance
    - Planned downtime by Azure to improve physical infrastructure to improve reliability, performance, security...
    - Usually performed without impact on VM
  - Unplanned maintenance
    - Azure predicts that hardware will fail
    - Azure automatically migrates VM to new hardware
    - Performance might be reduced before or after migration
  - Unexpected downtime
    - Hardware fails unexpectedly
    - Azure automatically migrates VM to new hardware
- Availability sets
  - Logical grouping of VMs
  - Reduces chance of all grouped VMs to fail at once
  - Azure ensures grouped VMs run across multiple physical...
    - Servers
    - Racks
    - Storage units
    - Network switches
  - Update domains
    - Contains a set of VMs and associated physical hardware that can be updated and rebooted at the same time
    - During planned maintenance, only one update domain is rebooted at a time
    - Can configure up to 20 update domains (default 5)
  - Fault domains
    - Contains a set of VMs that share a common set of hardware (e.g. a server rack with shared power and networking)
    - Mitigates against hardware failure
    - Can configure up to 3 fault domains

  - Considerations:
    - All VMs in an availability set should have same software installed
    - All VMs in an availability set should perform identical tasks
  - A VM can only be added to an availability set during creation
  - To move a VM to another set, the VM must be recreated
- Availability zones
  - Unique physical locations within an Azure region
  - Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling and networking.
  - Each region has a minimum of three separate zones
  - Protects against datacenter failures
  - Each availability zone functions as an update domain and a fault domain
- Scalability
  - Vertical scaling
    - Scale up and scale down
    - Makes a VM more (scale up) or less (scale down) powerful
    - Depends on available power hardware
    - Usually requires VM to restart
  - Horizontal scaling
    - Scale out and scale in
    - Increase (scale out) or decrease (scale in) number of VMs
    - Greater flexibility
      - Could potentially scale to thousands of VMs
- Virtual Machine Scale Sets
  - Deploy and manage a set of identical VMs
  - Supports up to 1000 VM instances (default 100, but can be expanded to 1000)
  - Use Load Balancer or Application Gateway for traffic distribution
  - Adding and removing VMs can be manual, automated or both
  - Orchestration modes
    - Flexible: manually add and remove VMs
    - Uniform: define a VM model, and let Azure automatically create VMs based on model
  - Manual scaling
    - Manually create new VM
  - Autoscaling
    - Automatically scale on workload, for example:
      - Scale out when CPU goes above 80%
      - Scale in when CPU goes below 10%
    - Automatically scale on schedule, for example:
      - Scale out on Monday morning
      - Scale in on Friday evening
    - Define minimum, maximum and default number of VMs
    - Define number of VMs to scale by (e.g. create two new VMs each time we scale out)
    - Separate rules for scale out and scale in
  - Availability zones can be configured to spread VMs

## Configure Azure App Service plans

- Azure App Service
  - Run Web Apps or Function Apps
- Application runs in an App Service plan
- App Service plans can be compared to traditional web servers
- A single App Service plan can run one or more applications
  - You can continue to add more applications to a plan as long as there are enough resources
- Each plan defines three settings:
    1. Region
    1. Number of VM instances
    1. Size of VM instances
- Pricing tiers:
  - Free and Shared
    - Applications might run on same VMs as other people's applications
    - No service-level agreement (SLA) (basically, no guaranteed performance or uptime)
    - 1 GB disk space
    - Usage: Development and testing
  - Basic
    - Designed for lower traffic applications
    - Manual scale out to 3 instances
    - 10 GB disk space
    - Usage: Dedicated development and testing
  - Standard
    - Designed for high traffic applications
    - Scale out to 10 instances
    - Supports autoscale
    - 50 GB disk space
    - Usage: Production
  - Premium
    - Designed for highest performance
    - Scale out to 30 instances
    - 250 GB disk space
    - Usage: Enhanced performance and scale
  - Isolated
    - Designed to run critical workloads in virtual networks
    - Runs applications in a private, dedicated environment
    - Scale out to 100 instances
    - 1 TB disk space
    - Usage: Highest performance, security and isolation
- When to use shared App Service plan:
  - Save cost by adding applications to existing plan
  - Share autoscale configuration across multiple configurations
- When to use separate App Service plans:
  - Application is resource intensive
  - You want to scale the application independently
  - The application needs to run in a separate region
- Scaling
  - Supported in Basic and above tiers
  - Supports both vertical and horizontal scaling
  - All applications on a plan scale together
    - If a plan is configured to run 5 instances, then all applications run on all 5 instances
    - If a plan is configured to autoscale, then all applications are scaled together
  - Autoscale
    - Automatic horizontal scaling based on rules, exactly like VMs
    - Supported in Standard and above tiers
