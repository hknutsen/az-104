# Configure and manage virtual networks

## Configure virtual networks

- Virtual network (vNet)
  - Fundamental component of private networks
  - Enables resources to communicate securely through vNet
  - Can still configure endpoints for services that require internet communication
  - By default, outbound traffic allowed
  - By default, inbound traffic only allowed within vNet
- Quick overview
  - Logical isolation of the Azure cloud, dedicated to your subscription
  - Segment vNet into subnets
  - Control DNS server settings within vNet
  - Each vNet has its own address space
    - Specified in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format
    - An address space specified in CIDR format is also often referred to as a CIDR block
  - A vNet can be linked to other vNets or on-premises networks (hybrid cloud scenarios)
- Subnets
  - Logical segments within vNet
  - Each subnet contains a range of IP addresses from the vNet address space
    - Also specified in CIDR format
  - The address range of one subnet can't overlap with the range of any other subnet in the same vNet
  - For each subnet, Azure reserves 5 IP addresses
    - First address: identifies vNet address
    - Second address: configured by Azure as default gateway
    - Third and fourth: Azure maps these Azure DNS IP addresses to the virtual network space
    - Last address: broadcast address
- Planning considerations:
  - Use and address space that's not already in use within your organization
  - Ensure non-overlapping address ranges for subnets
  - Service requirements
    - Each Azure service has different requirements for associated subnets
    - Some services require dedicated subnets, e.g. Azure VPN Gateway
    - Some services require different subnet sizes depending on scaling, e.g. App Services
  - Network virtual appliances
    - By default, all traffic allowed between subnets in a vNet
    - Possible to override this, and route traffic between subnets through a network virtual appliance
      - E.g., a VM running a firewall to only allow certain traffic
  - Service endpoints
    - Enable service endpoints in specific subnets
    - E.g., enable the service endpoint for Azure Storage in a subnet to allow access to Storage services
    - ... or don't enable service endpoints to prevent certain accesses
  - Network security groups
    - Associate an NSG to a subnet
    - Allow or deny traffic to and from sources and destinations
    - Can associate one NSG to multiple subnets
      - But only one NSG per subnet!
  - Private links
    - Provides private connectivity from a virtual network to Azure, customer-owned or Microsoft partner services
    - Configure and use private endpoints
      - Private endpoints only reachable within vNet
    - Optionally remove public endpoints entirely
    - Eliminates data expore to the public internet
- IP addresses
  - Types:
    - Private: enables communication within a vNet and on-premises network
    - Public: enables communication with the internet.

      ![Private and public IPs in Azure](../img/private-public-ips.png)

    - Assignment:
      - Dynamic
      - Static
        - IP address doesn't change
        - Useful for scenarios where you don't want IP to change:
          - DNS records, where a change in address would require updating the DNS record
          - Firewall rules, where a change in address would require updating the firewall rule
          - TLS/SSL certificates linked to IP address, where a change in address would require a new certificate
      - Dynamically and statically assigned IP resources can be separated into different subnets
      - Dynamic and static relevant for both private and public IPs
  - Azure Public IP address
    - Separate resource in Azure with following configuration
      - Name
      - IP version: IPv4, IPv6 or both
      - SKU: Basic or Standard
        - Basic SKU to be retired by 30 September 2025
        - Standard SKU supports zone redundance
          - Enabled by default
      - Assignment (Static or Dynamic)
        - Dynamic only available for Basic SKU, which is being retired
    - Associate with a resource:
      - Azure VM network interface card (NIC)
      - Load balancer (public IP and Load balancer SKUs must match)
      - Application gateway
      - VPN gateway

## Configure network security groups

- Network security group (NSG)
- Security rules
  - Control access within vNet
  - Create rules that allow/deny specific traffic
  - Configuration:
    - Name
    - Priority
      - Lower priority rules are applied first
        - Example: If a lower priority rule allows traffic and a higher priority rule denies traffic, it'll be allowed
    - Port (e.g. 443 for HTTPS)
    - Protocol (Any, TCP, UDP)
    - Source (Any, IP addresses, service tags...)
      - Example service tags: `Internet`, `VirtualNetwork`, `Storage`...
    - Destination (Any, IP addresses, service tags...)
    - Action (Allow or Deny)
  - Several rules created by default:
    - Inbound:
      - `AllowVNetInBound` (priority 65000)
      - `AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound` (priority 65001)
      - `DenyAllInBound` (priority 65500)
    - Outbound:
      - `AllowVnetOutBound` (priority 65000)
      - `AllowInternetOutBound` (priority 65001)
      - `DenyAllOutBound` (priority 65500)
    - These cannot be deleted
      - However, you can override them by creating rules with lower priorities
    - Prevent resources within subnet to communicate with each other by denying all inbound and outbound traffic
- Associate NSG with one or more subnets or NICs
  - Only one NSG per subnet!
  - One or more NSGs per NIC
  - For inbound traffic, NSG security rules are first processed for subnets then NICs
  - For outbound traffic, NSG security rules are first processed for NICs then subnets
- Application security group (ASG)
  - Join one or more VMs to an ASG, then use ASG as source or destination in NSG security rules
    - Join by associating with the NIC that is attached to the VM
  - Logically group VMs by workload
    - For example, one ASG for web server VMs, another ASG for database server VMs...
  - Removes need to specify IP addresses in NSG security rules
  - Simplifies NSG security rules
    - Easier to read and understand descriptive ASG names rather than IPs
  - Don't need to rely so much on multiple subnets for logical groupings

## Configure Azure DNS

- Domain name system (DNS)
  - Domain name resolution (i.e. translate domain name to IP address)
  - DNS record: contains domain mappings
    - Multiple record types
    - Example record types:
      - A record: domain name to IP address mapping
      - CNAME (canonical name) record: domain name to domain name (aka. alias)
- Azure DNS allows you to manage your domain and host DNS records
- When you create an Azure AD tenant, you need to specify a `<your-domain>.onmicrosoft.com` domain.
  - `<your-domain>` must be globally unique
  - Possible to configure custom domain name, e.g. `<your-domain>.com`.
    - Must be verified owner of that domain name
      - Verify by creating a record at domain registrar (company you bought the domain name from)
      - Must be MX (Mail Exchange) or TXT (Text) record

        ![Azure AD custom domain registration](../img/azure-ad-custom-domain-registration.png)

    - Custom domain names must also be globally unique, so two tenants cannot use same custom domain name
- Azure DNS zones
  - Used to manage your domain
  - Hosts DNS records for a domain
  - The name of the DNS zone resource should be your domain name, e.g. `contoso.com`
  - You can have multiple DNS zones with the same name but in different resource groups
  - Each DNS zone with same name is assigned a different DNS name server address
  - The root/parent domain is registered at registrar then pointed to Azure DNS
  - Child domains are registered directly in Azure DNS by creating DNS records
- DNS delegation
  1. Identify DNS name servers
      - Automatically assigned to your DNS zone after creation
      - 4 servers are assigned
  1. Update parent domain
      - Go into the registrars DNS management tool update the NS (name server) records for all 4 assigned servers
      - Make sure to include any trailing `.`, for example: `ns1-02.azure-dns.com.`, as it indicates the end of a domain name.
  1. (Optional) Delegate subdomains
      - Delegate management of subdomains by creating separate DNS zones, e.g. `mail.contoso.com`
      - In the DNS zone for the root domain, create an NS record that maps name `mail` to the 4 DNS name servers of the DNS zone for the `mail` subdomain
- DNS records
  - Configuration
    - Name
    - Type
    - Time to live (TTL)
    - Target address (e.g. IP address or domain name)
  - Record sets: domain name mapped to set of records
    - Azure DNS manages all records as record sets
    - Most sets contain only a single record
    - Some exceptions, e.g. NS records
    - Not supported for CNAME records
- Azure Private DNS zones
  - Provides name resolution within vNet
  - Autoregistration: can automatically maintain records for VMs within vNet
    - Example:
      - You create a private DNS zone `contoso.com`
      - You link the zone to your vNet and configure autoregistration
      - You create a VM `vm1` in your vNet, it's auto registered in the zone.
      - You create a VM `vm2` in your vNet, it's auto registered in the zone.
      - `vm1` and `vm2` can now be reached within the vNet on `vm1.contoso.com` and `vm2.contoso.com` respectively
  - A single Private DNS zone can be used across multiple vNets
    - Simplifies vNet peering
  - Split-horizon DNS:
    - A private and a public DNS zone can share same name
    - Resolves to different addresses within vNet and from public internet
