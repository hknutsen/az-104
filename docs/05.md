# Configure and manage virtual networks

## Configure virtual networks

- Virtual network (vNet)
  - Fundamental component of private networks
  - Enables resources to communicate securely through vNet
  - Can still configure endpoints for services that require internet communication
  - By default, outbound traffic allowed
  - By default, inbound traffic only allowed within vNet
- Quick overview
  - Logical isolation of the Azure cloud, dedicated to your subscription
  - Segment vNet into subnets
  - Control DNS server settings within vNet
  - Each vNet has its own address space
    - Specified in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format
    - An address space specified in CIDR format is also often referred to as a CIDR block
  - A vNet can be linked to other vNets or on-premises networks (hybrid cloud scenarios)
- Subnets
  - Logical segments within vNet
  - Each subnet contains a range of IP addresses from the vNet address space
    - Also specified in CIDR format
  - The address range of one subnet can't overlap with the range of any other subnet in the same vNet
  - For each subnet, Azure reserves 5 IP addresses
    - First address: identifies vNet address
    - Second address: configured by Azure as default gateway
    - Third and fourth: Azure maps these Azure DNS IP addresses to the virtual network space
    - Last address: broadcast address
- Planning considerations:
  - Use and address space that's not already in use within your organization
  - Ensure non-overlapping address ranges for subnets
  - Service requirements
    - Each Azure service has different requirements for associated subnets
    - Some services require dedicated subnets, e.g. Azure VPN Gateway
    - Some services require different subnet sizes depending on scaling, e.g. App Services
  - Network virtual appliances
    - By default, all traffic allowed between subnets in a vNet
    - Possible to override this, and route traffic between subnets through a network virtual appliance
      - E.g., a VM running a firewall to only allow certain traffic
  - Service endpoints
    - Enable service endpoints in specific subnets
    - E.g., enable the service endpoint for Azure Storage in a subnet to allow access to Storage services
    - ... or don't enable service endpoints to prevent certain accesses
  - Network security groups
    - Associate an NSG to a subnet
    - Allow or deny traffic to and from sources and destinations
    - Can associate one NSG to multiple subnets
      - But only one NSG per subnet!
  - Private links
    - Provides private connectivity from a virtual network to Azure, customer-owned or Microsoft partner services
    - Configure and use private endpoints
      - Private endpoints only reachable within vNet
    - Optionally remove public endpoints entirely
    - Eliminates data expore to the public internet
- IP addresses
  - Types:
    - Private: enables communication within a vNet and on-premises network
    - Public: enables communication with the internet.

      ![Private and public IPs in Azure](../img/private-public-ips.png)

    - Assignment:
      - Dynamic
      - Static
        - IP address doesn't change
        - Useful for scenarios where you don't want IP to change:
          - DNS records, where a change in address would require updating the DNS record
          - Firewall rules, where a change in address would require updating the firewall rule
          - TLS/SSL certificates linked to IP address, where a change in address would require a new certificate
      - Dynamically and statically assigned IP resources can be separated into different subnets
      - Dynamic and static relevant for both private and public IPs
  - Azure Public IP address
    - Separate resource in Azure with following configuration
      - Name
      - IP version: IPv4, IPv6 or both
      - SKU: Basic or Standard
        - Basic SKU to be retired by 30 September 2025
        - Standard SKU supports zone redundance
          - Enabled by default
      - Assignment (Static or Dynamic)
        - Dynamic only available for Basic SKU, which is being retired
    - Associate with a resource:
      - Azure VM network interface card (NIC)
      - Load balancer (public IP and Load balancer SKUs must match)
      - Application gateway
      - VPN gateway

## Configure network security groups

- Network security group (NSG)
- Security rules
  - Control access within vNet
  - Create rules that allow/deny specific traffic
  - Configuration:
    - Name
    - Priority
      - Lower priority rules are applied first
        - Example: If a lower priority rule allows traffic and a higher priority rule denies traffic, it'll be allowed
    - Port (e.g. 443 for HTTPS)
    - Protocol (Any, TCP, UDP)
    - Source (Any, IP addresses, service tags...)
    - Destination (Any, IP addresses, service tags...)
    - Action (Allow or Deny)
  - Several rules created by default:
    - Inbound:
      - `AllowVNetInBound` (priority 65000)
      - `AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound` (priority 65001)
      - `DenyAllInBound` (priority 65500)
    - Outbound:
      - `AllowVnetOutBound` (priority 65000)
      - `AllowInternetOutBound` (priority 65001)
      - `DenyAllOutBound` (priority 65500)
    - These cannot be deleted
      - However, you can override them by creating rules with lower priorities
    - Prevent resources within subnet to communicate with each other by denying all inbound and outbound traffic
- Associate NSG with one or more subnets or NICs
  - Only one NSG per subnet!
  - One or more NSGs per NIC
  - For inbound traffic, NSG security rules are first processed for subnets then NICs
  - For outbound traffic, NSG security rules are first processed for NICs then subnets
- Application security group (ASG)
  - Join one or more VMs to an ASG, then use ASG as source or destination in NSG security rules
    - Join by associating with the NIC that is attached to the VM
  - Logically group VMs by workload
    - For example, one ASG for web server VMs, another ASG for database server VMs...
  - Removes need to specify IP addresses in NSG security rules
  - Simplifies NSG security rules
    - Easier to read and understand descriptive ASG names rather than IPs
  - Don't need to rely so much on multiple subnets for logical groupings
